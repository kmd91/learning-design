        <h2>Assessment in the face of abundant GenAI tools</h2>
            <p>The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence within the last few years and the abundance of advanced tools and models, such as ChatGPT, have influenced the way university students approach their written assignments, especially in language courses. While one cannot ignore the significant positive impact of GenAI in language learning by allowing language teachers to design and develop engaging and learner-centered activities and materials for learning, it has simultaneously started challenging the conventional assessment tasks used to measure learning progress. Standard written assignments like essays, reports, analyses, and summaries are now increasingly prone to cheating as they can be effortlessly generated by ChatGPT and other similar tools with simplistic command prompts from students.</p>
            <p>The go-to method of checking against copied texts and ideas using tools like Turnitin in the pre-GenAI era to detect plagiarism and cheating is futile at the moment since the current platforms to filter out AI-generated content provide very low levels of accuracy. On top of that, there is an ongoing debate whether content generated by AI is considered plagiarism as it normally produces brand new texts that are not likely to be found elsewhere on the internet. The new challenge of appropriately evaluating learners’ growth and development within the small context of a language course still remains largely unsolved.</p>
            <p>Having said that, various educators and institutions around the globe have begun designing and experimenting with methods of assessment that can hold up in the current language education landscape, which is heavily influenced by GenAI. For instance, McCormack (2023) advocates for the following five alternative assessment types that help evaluate student learning without many compromises to cope with GenAI:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Oral Presentations</b>: Students can give oral presentations on the topic they have been studying. This will enable the instructor to evaluate their public speaking skills and comprehension of the subject matter.
                <br><i><b>How?</b></i>                   
                    <ul style="display: block;">
                        <li>Assign specific topics to students that require critical thinking and personal interpretation.</li>
                        <li>Ask students to provide an outline of their presentation ahead of time to ensure original content.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This will enable the instructor to evaluate their public speaking skills and comprehension of the subject matter.
                </li>
                <li><b>Group work</b>: Assign students to work in small groups to complete a project. This will enable the instructor to assess their ability to work as a team and collaborate, as well as their understanding of the subject matter.
                <br><i><b>How?</b></i>                   
                    <ul style="display: block;">
                        <li>Assign specific roles and responsibilities to each student to ensure collaboration.</li>
                        <li>Request that each group submits a progress report throughout the project's timeline by mandating staged submission (e.g., outline &gt; research notes &gt; drafts &gt; final version) ("Generative AI and assessment," 2023).</li>
                        <li>Schedule group meetings with the instructor to check on progress and discuss the project's direction.</li>
                        <li>Ask students to use sources from paywalled journals and databases (available through university subscription) that are not accessible to ChatGPT and other GenAI ("Generative AI and assessment," 2023).</li>
                    </ul>
                    This will enable the instructor to assess their ability to work as a team and collaborate, as well as their understanding of the subject matter.
                </li>
                <li><b>Self-reflection</b>: Students can reflect on their own learning through written or oral reflections. This will enable the instructor to assess their ability to think about their own learning process, their level of self-awareness, and their metacognitive skills.
                <br><i><b>How?</b></i>                   
                    <ul style="display: block;">
                        <li>Ask students to reflect on their personal experiences or insights related to the course material (e.g., ‘how is this issue relevant to your own, local situation?”) ("Generative AI and assessment," 2023).</li>
                        <li>Request that students provide evidence or examples to support their reflection.</li>
                        <li>Discuss the reflection with the student in-person to ensure their understanding of the material.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This will enable the instructor to assess their ability to think about their own learning process, their level of self-awareness, and their metacognitive skills.
                </li>
                <li><b>Peer evaluation</b>: Students can assess the work of their classmates. This will enable the instructor to evaluate their understanding of the subject matter, as well as their ability to give and receive constructive feedback.
                <br><i><b>How?</b></i>                   
                    <ul style="display: block;">
                        <li>Provide a rubric or guidelines for students to evaluate their peers' work.</li>
                        <li>Ask students to provide detailed feedback and reasoning for their evaluation.</li>
                        <li>Request a face-to-face meeting with each student to discuss their feedback and evaluation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This will enable the instructor to evaluate their understanding of the subject matter, as well as their ability to give and receive constructive feedback.
                </li>
                <li><b>Performance-based assessment</b>: Students can demonstrate their understanding of the language through projects or activities that require them to use the language in real-world situations. For example, students are given scenarios to act out, such as a job interview or a travel situation, and are assessed on their ability to use the language in a realistic and effective way. They can also be tasked with creating a podcast or a video presentation. This will enable the instructor to assess their comprehension of the language, as well as their critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
                <br><i><b>How?</b></i>                   
                    <ul style="display: block;">
                        <li>Assign a unique project or experiment to each student to prevent group cheating.</li>
                        <li>Request progress updates and specific data throughout the project's timeline.</li>
                        <li>Ask students to submit a written report detailing their thought process and decision-making.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This will enable the instructor to assess their comprehension of the language, as well as their critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Students can demonstrate their understanding of the language through projects or activities that require them to use the language in real-world situations. For example, students are given scenarios to act out, such as a job interview or a travel situation, and are assessed on their ability to use the language in a realistic and effective way.
